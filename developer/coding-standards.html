                <h2>Basic Coding Standards</h2>
                <p>We try not to have too many standards and best practices, and try to give people the freedom to code however they are accustomed. However, we do have a few things defined so that when we write our code, it is in a similar fashion. This allows us to work as a team to pick up projects and hop on and off as needed.</p>
                <p>By following a few simple rules and not getting too high-level or in the weeds, we can hand off projects with little to no documentation to other front end developers on the team.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="ResponsiveDesign">
                <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                <h3>All our websites, emails, and landing pages should be responsive.</h3>
                <p>If we are doing the designs for the website, you will receive a home page design for both mobile and desktop versions of the website.  Then, you wil receive either interior designs for each unique page, or a component library design to build the rest of the website. If budget and timeline allow you might receive additional responsive concepts for complex components, or if you really need something ask your project manager to request the designer to design something out.  We have decided on this workflow to do a couple things, a) it saves budget and time; b) it gives us flexibility in how we write the markup.</p>
                <h3>Mobile First</h3>
                <p>All sites, unless it's not responsive, should be built with the mobile device in mind first, then enhancing the site as the browser gets larger (more on <a href="#ProgressiveEnhancement">enhancing</a> the site later). This means, your mobile code should be accessed without the use of a media query.</p>
                <p>Here's a few reasons why we're going mobile first:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phones Processor<br />
                        The processor on a phone is not as strong as the processor on a computer, connection speeds aren't as good, and therefore you don't want to load things that aren't necessary.</li>
                    <li>Simpler Base<br>
                        Generally the mobile device has simpler styles, but are still used to set a base for the others, this creates more streamlined code.</li>
                    <li>Fewer Overrides<br>
                        You'll probably have fewer things you'll need to override starting with the mobile device, you won't have to take out the annoying hover effects that only work on larger browsers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This approach also allows you to code media queries using min-width only and go in a single direction, making the code much easier to understand.</p>
                <p>I don't want to re-write or plagiarize anymore content, so here is some further reading on the approach:</p>

                <h3>Configure the Viewport</h3>
                <p>By placing this meta tag: <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code>; at the top of your page you can make the page work on mobile and desktop.</p>
                <p>Additonal settings can be applied:</p>

                        <tr>

                            <td>The initial zoom when visiting the page. 1.0 does not zoom.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>minimum-scale</td>
                            <td>The minimum amount the visitor can zoom on the page. 1.0 does not zoom.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>maximum-scale</td>
                            <td>The maximum amount the visitor can zoom on the page. 1.0 does not zoom.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>user-scalable</td>
                            <td>Allows the device to zoom in and out. Values are yes or no.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>Generally, unless you are building an app, or absolutely don't want the user to scale, don't prevent scaling, as it is potentially opening a door for accessibility issues.</p>
                <p>Include the following to help IE on Windows Phone be responsive:</p>

                <h2>Progressive Enhancement vs Graceful Degradation</h2>
                <p>As a team, and as a company, we try to take the approach of progressively enhancing our websites, as opposed to gracefully degrading the experience. While this may seem like it's saying the same thing in different ways, they are fundamentally different.</p>
                <p>First, let's look at how we define each approach:</p>
                <p><strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong>: start by establishing our basic level. This is done by identifying what our base requirement of support is for the website, then building our base element to this specification. After that, we enhance the code by adding support for new features like transitions, transforms, transparent background elements, hover effects, etc. We should only be supporting features that are supported by each browser, accepting that there may be slight differences between browser experiences.</p>
                <p><strong>Graceful Degradation</strong>: start by building out the final result with all the bells and whistles. Then use plugins, polyfills, and hacks to make older browsers work the same.</p>
                <p>We utilize modernizr.js to test whether a feature that we want to use is supported or not supported, then write our CSS accordingly. Modernizr.js will add a class to the html tag identifying if the desired feature you tested for is or isn't available for use. Then you can make different definitions based on that feature.</p>
                <p>We do accept that each browser may vary in appearance slightly, however, the majority of the look and feel should be similar. Everything does need to function correctly, so a form has to submit or a wizard has to step you through each step of the process, but it doesn't have to animate between each step the same in every browser.</p>
                <p>While we try to be strict on our approach, there are some exceptions. Especially where a couple small lines of JavaScript can make something work across all browsers.</p>
                <p>Here are some things we want do, and how we want to do them:</p>
                <p><strong>Animations</strong>: all animations should be done using CSS wherever possible. You can trigger the animation by adding a class to the element or changing an attribute with JavaScript or jQuery, but the styles that are altered should be managed within CSS.</p>
                <p><strong>Transitions</strong>: same rules as animations.</p>
                <p><strong>SVG</strong>: use SVG for icons and images as much as possible. This may require the use of a third party tool like SnapSVG to do more sophisticated drawing and animations.</p>
                <p><strong>Text Shadows and Box Shadows</strong>: use CSS only to achieve this. If they don't exist in older browsers, that's an acceptable difference. It's not worth the additional markup or code and use of images to create such small effects.</p>
                <p><strong>Rounded Corners</strong>: use CSS border-radius for this feature. If an older browser doesn't support it, they will just get squared off corners. Again the extra weight of markup and images is not worth it to create rounded corners.</p>
                <p><strong>Video</strong>: using HTML 5 video for backgrounds or even self-hosting videos is a great approach. However, get a Flash player to fallback to using the HTML tags properly to work on older browsers. For the backgrounds, just load an image instead of the video.</p>
                <h3>Use Modernizr</h3>
                <p><a href="https://modernizr.com/" target="_blank">Modernizr.js</a> is an online utility that allows us to identify and detect if a browser supports a special feature. Outlined in the Progressive Enhancement vs. Graceful Degradation section, we said why we want to detect features over browsers and supply fallbacks for styling or features that may not be supported. We always want to try to enhance the experience over degrading, so keep that in mind when using detection.</p>
				<p>When using this tool, you can create a version custom built for your website, or you can load all the detections. Generally, it's easier to add the detections as you build the website and keep updating the file. The great thing about the download you receive when building Modernizr on their website is there will be a URL that you can go to that will have all your previously selected elements saved. Keep that in the JS file so that someone coming in later can use that link to select the right items you've already setup for detection.</p>

                        <p>ALL of our coding teams need to follow this in whatever IDE you choose to use.  Make sure the default for a tab is equal to inserting 4 spaces regardless of language.</p>

                    <li>
                    	<h5>Don't pull from Server</h5>
                        <p>If you have your site setup in an FTP client, don't pull files from the Remote, always push your local files or let automated build servers do the build for you.  Pulling the latest on the server may result in undesired changes being made.</p>

                        <p>Review your commit and make sure the code you are committing is code that you actually altered. If there's something you didn't do, review it carefully before committing to Git.</p>

                    <li>
                    	<h5>Camel Case IDs</h5>
                        <p>This will help distinguishing the difference between an ID and a class.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Dash Class Names</h5>
                        <p>Multi-word class names should be separated using dashes, this helps distinguish them from IDs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Naming Classes</h5>
                        <p>Class names should be related to what the object is used for, starting with the generic item then adding on a more specific use case.  For example, when creating multiple carousels for a site each carousel class should start with <code>carousel-</code> then have something more specific that you can target from there like <code>carousel-hero</code> and <code>carousel-testimonial</code>.</p>
                        <p>Name the class for use, not location or color, as that could cause issues if the color or location were to change.</p>

                <h2>HTML Standards</h2>
                <p>Follow these standard practices when writing HTML:</p>
                <ol>
                	<li>
                        <h5>Write Semantic Meaningful Markup</h5>
                        <p>With HTML5 we have the addition of meaningful tags like the header, main, footer, article, section, aside, and nav tags.  Use them, not only for making your content more accessible for users, and digestible by crawlers, but use also to apply CSS.</p>
                        <p>We shouldn't see something like <code>&lt;header role="header" class="header"&gt;</code>. That is a lot of redundancy and all that should be needed in this case is <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.  Style the main site header based on location to the body, or if working in DNN or other CMS's that add wrapping elements style based on it's relation to the wrapping element. Then if you have a hero on the page in your main article, make that a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and style it in corellation to the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>.</p>
                        <p>This will not only remove code from your HTML but will shrink your CSS substantially as well.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Keep the Code Layer Separate from the Design Layer</h5>
                        <p>Remember to take the MVC approach of Model|View|Control when building even a static website.  Your View layer should be separated from your Control layer.  HTML should only be used for the control layer, while CSS will be in place for controlling look and feel.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="CSSStandards">
                <h2>CSS Standards</h2>
                <p>Follow these standard practices when writing CSS:</p>
                <ol>
                	<li>
                    	<h5>Each Property On a Line</h5>
                        <p>Writing this way helps with version control so you can see exactly what changed within each commit.  It will also help with resolving merge conflicts.</p>
                        <p>Since most of our sites use LESS, they will be compiled into a single line and minified. So, readability in the file is more important than file size.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Avoid The Use of IDs</h5>
                        <p>Avoiding ID's in CSS creates more re-usable code since ID's can only be used once on a page while classes can be used multiple times.</p>
                        <p>The other issue when working with CMS sites is often ID's are controlled and created dynamically causing them to be unreliable if the component is deleted and re-added to a page.</p>

            <section id="JavaScriptStandards">
                <h2>JavaScript Standards</h2>
                <p>Follow these standard practices when writing JavaScript:</p>
                <ol>
                	<li>
                    	<h5>Use jQuery</h5>
                        <p>As far as JavaScript libraries go, we've chosen <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> as our standard library. While other libraries exist, this remains one of the most common libraries and unless a client requests us to use something different jQuery should be used on all R2i projects.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Use Bootstrap</h5>
                        <p>As far as JavaScript frameworks go, we've chosen to utilize <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for our standard framework.  While we don't load Bootstraps CSS file and have chosen to move away from the weight that it creates, we still want to utilize the JavaScript framework. Base CSS files have been created in the boilerplates to give us the styles needed to work with the Bootstrap JavaScript framework.</p>
                    </li>
                	<li>
                    	<h5>Use <code>.on()</code> To Bind Events</h5>
                        <p>Instead of using <code>.click()</code>, <code>.mouseenter()</code>, <code>.mouseout()</code>, etc to bind a function, use the <code>.on()</code> and <code>.off()</code> to bind and unbind functions to the those events. This will make it easier to bind and unbind events, and is the jQuery standard even though those events still work for the time being.</p>
                        <p>Do this for all events, except <code>.ready()</code> as it could cause issues.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Be Consistent</h5>
                        <p>Be consistent with your use of punctuation in JavaScript, it doesn't matter if you use ' or ", $ or jQuery, just pick an approach and be consistent with that throughout the project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    	<h5>Use Plugins When Necessary.</h5>
                        <p>Feel free to utilize additional plugins as needed, but try not to use one if it's a simple 5-10 line function, and check out our standards for things before choosing a different plugin.</p>
                        <p>We have standard plugins for <a href="forms.html#Selects">Selects</a>, <a href="forms.html#DateInputs">Date Picker</a>, <a href="carousels.html">Carousels</a>, <a href="tabs.html">Tabs</a>, <a href="accordions.html">Accordions</a>, <a href="modals.html">Modals</a>, etc.</p>
